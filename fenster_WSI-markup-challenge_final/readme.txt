Hello West Elm, My Name is Jeff Fenster! 

I am an experienced and passionate Web Developer who loves building things of all varieties. I am moving to the city from Pittsburgh next week and am looking for an interesting company near Brooklyn to challenge and expand my skill set, and to push my career forward. West Elm seems like an amazing fit!

I hope my application impresses! I put a lot of effort into my project and I hope that it shows how much I would love to work for West Elm. I built it out using angular to demonstrate a thorough understanding of a modern framework. 

Features include:
	1. Working Cart (In lieu of a modal, I built out a working shopping cart where you can add Items and see the products and subtotal update when you hover over the cart div. In addition, adding the same item to the cart will simply update the quantity and not add the same product twice!)
	
	2. Live Updating components (components will pass updated data to eachother, you'll notice the breadcrumbs, cart, product info, and product carousel all update as you select the different products in the Carousel)
	
	3. Accordian Text (styles will change as you expand and collapse different options)
	
	4. Image Carousel (Selecting a low-res thumbail will not only swap out the hero image with something high res, but will also swap the currently selected product out for the newly selected product and update all page data accordingly)

To Run:
	1. Drag HTML file into the browser

A Quick Note:
	1. To navigate around the fact that browsers will block Cross Origin Requests, I used something called "$templateCache" for my angular component templates. This allows me to define my templates in script tags towards the bottom of the HTML document.

Thank You! I look forward to hearing back from you, even if it is just with constructive criticism.

Jeff Fenster
